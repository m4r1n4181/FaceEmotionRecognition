# Face Emotion Recognition

A deep learning-based project for recognizing human emotions from facial images using PyTorch and EfficientNet. This project is designed to classify emotions such as angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.

## About the Project

This project uses a deep learning model built with PyTorch and EfficientNet to classify human emotions from facial images. It is trained on the [Facial Expression Dataset](https://github.com/parth1620/Facial-Expression-Dataset) and can be used for real-time emotion detection or batch processing of images.

## Features

- Emotion classification for 7 classes: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.
- Pre-trained EfficientNet model for high accuracy.
- Support for training on custom datasets.
- Real-time emotion prediction from images.
- Easy-to-use functions for training and inference.
